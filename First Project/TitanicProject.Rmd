## Historical Introduction 
The history and the data that we have in this presentation is about the disaster of the Titanic. The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early hours of 15 April 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City.

Route:	Southampton to New York City

```{r, echo=FALSE}
   knitr::include_graphics('./Titanic.jpg')
```

## Introduction
In this project we are going to analize a data set of the titanic that we have and we are going to make the data analysis in a language R and I'm going to use CSS to give some style to the presentation.
Just to introduce yourself to the dataset and the analysis, There were a total 2224 persons and there were lifeboats for only 1178 people. Therefore 1500 people died out of 2224. This is not just a movie but a real story of Titanic ship that crashed in April, 1912.
