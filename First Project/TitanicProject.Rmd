## Historical Introduction 
The history and the data that we have in this presentation is about the disaster of the Titanic. The Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early hours of 15 April 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City.

Route:	Southampton to New York City

```{r, echo=FALSE}
   knitr::include_graphics('./Titanic.jpg')
```

## Introduction
In this project we are going to analize a data set of the titanic that we have and we are going to make the data analysis in a language R and I'm going to use CSS to give some style to the presentation.
Just to introduce yourself to the dataset and the analysis, There were a total 2224 persons and there were lifeboats for only 1178 people. Therefore 1500 people died out of 2224. This is not just a movie but a real story of Titanic ship that crashed in April, 1912.

## Exploring the Dataset
<strong>Let's see the data that we have and the characteristics that we have.</strong>
```{r,echo=FALSE}
head(titanic_data,1)
```

## Exploring the Dataset
<strong>Let's see the data that we have and the structure of the data</strong>
```{r,echo=FALSE}
str(titanic_data)
```

## Exploring the Dataset
<strong>Let's see now the missing data</strong>
```{r}
colSums(is.na(titanic_data))
```
## Trying to solve the mising data
<strong>In this case we are not going to do a model or a prediction, the only solution I'm going to implement is to fill those missing values with the mean of the column or with another value </strong>
```{r}
colSums(titanic_data=="")
titanic_data$Embarked[titanic_data$Embarked==""]="C"
cols<-c("Survived","Pclass","Sex","Embarked")
for (i in cols){
  titanic_data[,i] <- as.factor(titanic_data[,i])
}
```


## Let's going to work with this now
```{r}
str(titanic_data)
```



## Characteristics of the Dataset
  -PassengerId: Id of every passenger</br></br>
  -Survived: If a passenger survived has 1 and 0 if It didn't</br></br>
  -Pclass: We have 3 classes of passengers. Class: 1, 2 and 3</br></br>
  -Name: The name of the passenger</br></br>
  -Sex: The gender of the passenger</br></br>
  -Age: Age of passenger.</br></br>
  -SibSp: Indication that passenger have siblings and spouse.</br></br>
  -Parch: Whether a passenger is alone or have family.</br></br>

## Characteristics of the Dataset
  -Ticket: Ticket no of passenger.</br></br>
  -Fare: Indicating the fare.</br></br>
  -Cabin: The cabin of passenger.</br></br>
  -Embarked: Port of embarkation. C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S =              Southampton</br></br>
